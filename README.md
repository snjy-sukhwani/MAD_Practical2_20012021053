## Files in Android Project

### activity_main.xml
- This is a XML File which is responsible for the Designing part of our Application
- It is like HTML but in XML we can create our Own Tags
- Also There is a Option of Code and Design i.e, The code will be automatically generated just by our Design
- We can just drag and drop the Components from the Palette Menu/Window in the required place in our design part
- Path of the File (*activity_main.xml*) : **```Project-Name\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml```**
- This is activity_main.xml file [White Screen is our main Application Design and the Blue Screen is the Blueprint of our Application]
